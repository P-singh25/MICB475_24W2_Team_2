## Lab Notebook 

[P01](/Notebook/P01.md) - Demultiplexing, Denoising and Clustering - QIIME 2   <br/>
[P02](/Notebook/P02.md)- Taxonomic Analysis - QIIME 2   <br/> 
[P03](/Notebook/P03.md) - Alpha-rarefaction, Phyloseq and Rarecurve - R   <br/>
[P04](/Notebook/P04.md) - Aim 1: To determine microbial diversity difference across gut, MLN, Spleen, TDLN, and tumor before and after ICI treatment.   <br/>
[P05](/Notebook/P05.md) - Aim 2:  To identify specific bacterial species that are differentially abundant in the secondary lymphoid organs and tumor post-ICI treatment, and their relationship to the gut microbiome.  <br/>
