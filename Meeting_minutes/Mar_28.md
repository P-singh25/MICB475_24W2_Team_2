## Agenda

See https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MUhiZ7W2_h0Ix_e1v_I4ckoV6U4LBi4b4HJwlLFKZrc/edit?tab=t.0

**Question:**

Alpha
  - "*" or actual p value
  - Need x-axis or not?
  - Need to talk about very pick shannon?

Deseq
  - G_mitochondria why is it there?

PICURST
  - what is the control?
  - sample 1: Pre-ICI
  - sample 2: Post-ICI3
  - so is Pre-ICI control or Post-ICI3
  - bigger eclipse = more diverse metabolic pathway??
  - How to interpret the heat map?

Overall:
  - should we just focus on spleen for all tests?
  - indictor species: can we just put the table in the paper?
  - base on abundance ok?

Limitation:
- cross contamination
- don't know which mice PD-1 worked


  ## Meeting Minutes

Include all organs, not just spleen

Figure 1: Alpha diversity
- panel A: all organs pre-treatment
- panel B: all organs post-treatment (ICI3)
- panel C: spleen only across treatments


Figure 2: Beta diversity (include in main figures, not supplemental)
- Bray curtis or unweighted unifrac


Figure 3: Taxa barplot
- Other should be gray


Figure 4: Core microbiome
- include spleen one
- Don't include pre and post, deviates from spleen story


Figure 5: Deseq spleen pre vs post ICI3
- pre should be on the right of vs


Table 1: indicator taxa
- keep stack and p value (0.7 or more)


Figure 6: Picrust
- look in literature at the pathways and see how they're associated with other diseases, preferably cancer
- panel A: pcA
- panel B: bar graph
- cannot say there's a great change in functional diversity because the pcA clusters overlap and there's only 8 pathways that are changed more than 2 fold
