## MICB475: Data Science Research in Microbiology
Team 2 - QingRu Kong, Pranjali Singh, Ran Tao, Tina Wang, Zurui Zhu

Feb 14th, 2025 

## Agenda
1. Further discuss the troubleshooting of processing of our dataset. 
2. How to update the changes to the code in R to Github- as even after pushing, the updated code isn't showing up on Github.
3. Should we abandon the translocation part of our proposal? - as stool even after troubleshooting has only has 1 sample - do we have to redo our proposal if we decide to go ahead with this?

## Meeting Minutes 
- Just proceed without gut translocation for now
- Figured out Faith PD
- TA will look over the data processing to see if we can get more than 2 pre-ICI gut sample
- represented instead of regulated
    - regulated only for RNAseq not for DNA
    - For our data, can only say more or less represented
- Core microbiome vs indicator species, consider which one
- Use a different column name instead of GROUP !!!!
