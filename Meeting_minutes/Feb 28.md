Team 2 - QingRu Kong, Pranjali Singh, Ran Tao, Tina Wang, Zurui Zhu

Feb 14th, 2025 

## Agenda
1. Further discuss the troubleshooting of processing of our dataset. 
2. How to update the changes to the code in R to Github- as even after pushing, the updated code isn't showing up on Github.
3. Should we abandon the translocation part of our proposal? - as stool even after troubleshooting has only has 1 sample - do we have to redo our proposal if we decide to go ahead with this?
