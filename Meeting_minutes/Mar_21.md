## Agenda

Questions:
1. How to generate a PCA plot - troubleshoot the code?
2. How to fix the visual of beta diversity - the dots appear too big.
3. How do we visualize Indicator species analysis data and interpret it?
- Look at the edited versions of all our figures.


## Meeting Minutes

Beta
- use Eclipse is good enough
- as long as eclipse doesn't overlap
- can keep the dots

Heatmap?
- don't use red and blue for x-axis, so not confusing
- do top 20, find greatest # but still able to read
