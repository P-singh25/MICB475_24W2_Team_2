## MICB475: Data Science Research in Microbiology
Team 2 - QingRu Kong, Pranjali Singh, Ran Tao, Tina Wang, Zurui Zhu

Feb 7th, 2025 

## Agenda
 **Depression dataset**
 Question Ideas:
→ Effect of different treatment regimen on microbiome, looking at combos
	→ can combine with the HIV Dataset (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10837999/)
	→ will look at confound variables to make sure these drugs are the ones making a difference
→ Metabolites
→ Different mental conditions 
→ Leukocytes

**IBD Human dataset**
Question ideas:
- Do different biopsy locations (e.g., sigmoid vs. right colon) exhibit distinct microbial compositions in patients with inflamed vs. non-inflamed tissue?
- Are specific microbial taxa enriched or depleted in patients with severe vs. mild disease phenotypes (as classified by Montreal classification)?
- Are there specific microbial patterns that differentiate Crohn’s Disease from Ulcerative Colitis at a metabolic pathway level?
- How do medication types impact gut microbiome composition and inflammation status in IBD patients?
- Do patients who have been diagnosed for longer show signs of microbial resilience or worsening dysbiosis compared to recently diagnosed individuals?

**All of the datasets are from the MICB475 database**
