## MICB475: Data Science Research in Microbiology
Team 2 - QingRu Kong, Pranjali Singh, Ran Tao, Tina Wang, Zurui Zhu

Feb 19th, 2025 


## Agenda

- Confirm how to proceed with paired-end sequences in Qiime 
- Rediscuss all the aims 
- Reframe the research question 

## Meeting Minutes 
Met with Hans through zoom

<br/>
Discussed and revised the current aims: 

#### Aim 1: To determine if the microbial diversity significantly differs across gut, MLN, Spleen, TDLN, and Tumor at baseline before ICI treatment
- Alpha diversity
- Beta diversity

#### Aim 2: To compare the microbial diversity across gut, MLN, Spleen, TDLN, and Tumor in melanoma mice model at the endpoint of ICI treatment
- Alpha diversity
- Beta diversity

#### Aim 3: To identify bacteria of interest that translocated from the gut to the secondary lymphoid organs and tumour post-ICI treatment 

Note: removed the word "longitudinal" as the samples at different timepoints were taken from different mice. 

- Taxa bar plots - change in abundance of certain taxa
- DESeq

#### Aim 4: Functional analyses of microbes of interest across organs and literature review
- PiCrust2
- literature review
<br/>

Reviewed the S16 rRNA sequencing method used by the authors and determined the forward and reverse primers used for the classifier.
