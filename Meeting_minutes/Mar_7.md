## Agenda

- Started on Alpha diversity, Beta diversity, and taxonomic bar plot

  
For next meeting:
- Ask Hans about removing black lines in our taxonomic bar plot
- Which level should we use for taxonomic bar plot? Phylum, genus, species
- Ask Hans about beta diversity plot, should we use weighted unifrac
- Ask Hans about alpha diversity plot and significance
- Proposal revision


## Meeting Minutes

**Taxonomic Bar Plot**
- need to normalize to 100%
- Relative abundance, number of ASV detected (**never absolute abundance**)
- Remove stool, not going to work
- facetwrap ok, putting everything in the same plot
- maybe something from before, during data processing is not done properly

   **Fix Suggestions:**
    - Remove prefix for taxonomic classification (ex. D__Domain, remove D__) in qiime - could remove for aesthetic but not the issue here
 
Revision
- Group AVS by GROUP (ex. PreICI) instead of SAMPLE
 
**Prosopsal revision**
- just fix the citation
