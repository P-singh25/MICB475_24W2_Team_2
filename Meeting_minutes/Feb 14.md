## Agenda

### Research question: 

What is the spatial microbial difference in separate organs at various time points throughout the ICT treatment in mice with melanoma? 

### Aim 1
1. Look at microbiome differences in different organs using Alpha diversity.
2. Weighted UniFrac Diversity analysis (beta diversity) using different grouping methods
   a. grouping by organs
   b. grouping by timepoints

### Aim 2
1. Track gut bacteria migration through different organs
2. Identify specific population of bacteria that are not previously present in other organs
3. Identify the emergence of new bacteria in the lymphoid organs at the endpoint, and backtrack the origin
